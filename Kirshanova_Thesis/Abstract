Abstract

This thesis is dedicated to the analysis of hard problems based on lattices in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. We consider the problems most relevant to cryptography, the Learning with Errors (LWE) Problem and the Shortest Vector Problem. 

Complexity of Learning with Errors problem, asymptotical and practical, is studied in the first part of the thesis. We analyze the hardness of LWE under lattice-based attacks and provide their running times of the form $2^{\const n + \smallo(n)}$, where we make the constant $\const$ explicit as a function of LWE parameters. From a theoretical perspective, our analysis reveals how the complexity of the problem changes as a function of its parameters. From a practical perspective our analysis is a useful tool to choose LWE parameters resistant to known attacks. We make our study complete by providing real running times of lattice-based LWE solvers for various ranges of parameters.

The second part of the thesis deals with heuristic sieving algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem. The main result is an algorithm with $2^{0.1877n+\smallo(n)}$ memory-complexity and $2^{0.396n+\smallo(n)}$ running time. The speed-up is obtain from an efficient algorithm for finding a triple of lattice-vectors whose sum has a short Euclidean norm.
